# Gonka Proxy

**No more 429s. No more 502s.** Gonka Proxy sits in front of your LLM providers and gives you one stable, OpenAI-compatible endpoint to point your app at. If one provider is rate-limited or down, it silently hands the request to the next one — your app never sees the error.

Tiny and cheap: it runs in under **10 MB of RAM** even under load, so you can run it next to anything.

## What it does

- Exposes **one local OpenAI-compatible endpoint** (`/v1/chat/completions`) — your app keeps talking to one URL, no matter what's happening upstream.
- Maintains a **priority-ordered pool of providers** (e.g. primary, then backups).
- On a **402, 429 or 5xx** (or a timeout/network error), it **fails over** to the next available provider in order.
- A failed provider goes into a short **cooldown**, then comes back automatically. If every provider is down, it waits and retries until one responds or you cancel.
- Maps one or more **virtual model names** to each provider's real model, so clients don't need to know or care which upstream you're using.
- Enforces one **reasoning effort** setting on every upstream request, with per-provider overrides for backends that don't support the parameter.

## Configuration

Copy the example and edit it:

```sh
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

The file is loaded once at startup, so **any change requires a restart**.

```yaml
server:
  listen_address: 0.0.0.0:8080   # where the proxy listens (host:port)

# Optional tuning — these are the defaults if omitted:
cooldown: 120s            # how long a failed provider is benched before retry
recovery_wait: 30s        # wait before probing again when all providers are down
response_header_timeout: 30s  # max time to wait for a provider's response headers
log_level: WARN           # INFO, WARN (default), or ERROR
health_history_path: health-history.json  # persistent provider health history

reasoning_effort: xhigh   # required; see "Reasoning effort" below

providers:                # one block per upstream, higher priority = preferred
  - name: primary
    base_url: https://provider.example/v1   # API root, not a /chat/completions URL
    api_key: your-key
    model_alias: provider-model-name        # real model name sent upstream
    priority: 100
  - name: backup
    base_url: https://backup.example/v1
    api_key: your-key
    model_alias: backup-model-name
    priority: 50          # tried only when primary is down or rate-limited
```

List your providers in any order; Gonka always tries the **highest `priority` number first**. Equal priorities keep YAML declaration order. Add as many blocks as you like.

`log_level` is a minimum severity. `INFO` includes detailed lifecycle diagnostics—Provider selection and successes, Cooldown and Recovery Wait transitions, and cancellation—while `WARN` (the default) suppresses those INFO-only events but retains Failover Failure and stream-abort events. `ERROR` is the strictest threshold and emits only ERROR-level events. At `INFO`, an error may include a bounded provider error message or stream tail; prompts, request bodies, authorization headers, and API keys are never logged, and response content is suppressed at `WARN` and `ERROR`.

### Multiple Virtual Models

For new configurations, define Provider aliases by Virtual Model and declare the Model Route order explicitly:

```yaml
providers:
  - name: gonka24
    base_url: https://provider.example/v1
    api_key: your-key
    model_aliases:
      gonka: deepseek-v4-flash-0731
      deepseek-v4-flash-0731: deepseek-v4-flash-0731
    priority: 100
  - name: easy-gonka
    base_url: https://backup.example/v1
    api_key: your-key
    model_aliases:
      glm-5.3-flash: glm-5.3-flash
    priority: 50

model_routes:
  gonka:
    providers: [gonka24]
  deepseek-v4-flash-0731:
    providers: [gonka24]
  glm-5.3-flash:
    providers: [easy-gonka]
```

The request's `model` selects a Model Route. A missing `model` selects `gonka`; an unknown model returns `404` when `model_routes` is configured. A legacy configuration containing only scalar `model_alias` values continues to route through `gonka` and retains the previous behavior.

Agents can discover the configured Virtual Models through the OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:58081/v1/models
```

It returns route IDs in configuration order with stable `model` metadata. Provider URLs, credentials, upstream aliases, and temporary Provider health are not exposed.

## Metrics

The proxy exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics at `GET /metrics` on the same address as the chat endpoint. Keep the listener on loopback when metrics must remain local:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:58081/metrics
```

Metrics are grouped by the configured provider name and include successful and failed provider attempts, upstream status/category, failovers, cooldown activations and skips, stream aborts, and latency histograms. The endpoint contains no request bodies, response bodies, authorization headers, or API keys. Useful signals include:

- `gonka_proxy_provider_upstream_responses_total` — upstream status and safe failure category;
- `gonka_proxy_provider_failovers_total` and `gonka_proxy_provider_cooldowns_total` — provider failures that caused routing changes;
- `gonka_proxy_provider_stream_aborts_total` — streams cut before the `[DONE]` marker or by a client/upstream read error;
- `gonka_proxy_provider_request_duration_seconds` — completed request latency per provider.

For a human-readable current summary, use `GET /health`:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:58081/health
```

The summary includes each provider's healthy/degraded/unavailable status, last success and error, cooldown transitions, request/error counts, and latency averages. The state is stored in `health_history_path`; writes use an atomic replacement and are best-effort, so an unavailable or read-only path does not stop routing. Events older than 30 days and entries beyond the latest 1,000 are removed.

For active provider diagnostics, use `GET /diagnostics`:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:58081/diagnostics
```

Diagnostics perform a safe `GET` request (by default to `<base_url>/models`) and never send chat messages, prompts, tools, or request bodies. They classify invalid keys, unavailable endpoints, rate/concurrency exhaustion, insufficient balance, and transient failures, with a remediation hint. A provider-specific `balance_url` can be configured when that API exists; otherwise the balance result is reported as `unavailable/unsupported`.

## Reasoning effort

`reasoning_effort` hints how much reasoning the upstream model should do. The proxy writes your configured value into every upstream request — whatever the client sends is overwritten. Allowed values: `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, plus `null` (`~`) to strip the field entirely. The top-level key is **required**.

Not all providers accept the parameter, so each provider block can override it:

```yaml
providers:
  - name: primary
    # ...
    reasoning_effort: high   # optional: use a different value for this provider
  - name: legacy
    # ...
    reasoning_effort: ~      # strip the field entirely for this provider
```

- Omitted on a provider → it inherits the global value.
- A value → overrides the global value for that provider.
- `~` → removes `reasoning_effort` from requests to that provider.

The same rules apply after failover: each provider always gets its own resolved setting.

### Provider support

> ***The data is current as of 2026-09-02. If you would like to add new data or update existing information, please open an issue and I will make the changes.***

Values each provider currently accepts for DeepSeek V4 Flash 0731 model:


| Provider       | low | medium | high | xhigh | max |
| -------------- | --- | ------ | ---- | ----- | --- |
| proxy.gonka.gg | OK  | OK     | OK   | OK    | OK  |
| GonkaRouter    | OK  | OK     | OK   | OK    | OK  |
| GonkaGate      | OK  | OK     | OK   | OK    | OK  |
| Gonka-API      | OK  | OK     | OK   | OK    | OK  |

**Note**: it seems that sometimes `reasoning_effort: max` support depends on devshard/node and might be unstable. Consider adding `reasoning_effort: high` fallbacks to your config.

A provider that does not support the configured value answers with **HTTP 400** and an error like `reasoning_effort: unsupported value: ...`. The proxy detects that message and **fails over** to the next provider, so a single unsupported provider no longer breaks the request. Other 400 responses are still passed back to your app unchanged. To avoid repeated cooldowns, point those providers at a value they accept (or `~` to strip the field) with a per-provider `reasoning_effort`.

To check provider support against your own configuration, run:

```sh
./check-reasoning-effort.sh
```

The script tests every configured provider with all five values, shows progress and an aligned results table.

## Launch

**Docker (recommended):**

```sh
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml   # then edit your providers
docker compose up --build
```

This publishes the proxy on `127.0.0.1:58081` and mounts `config.yaml` read-only. Point your app at `http://127.0.0.1:58081/v1`.

**Multiple instances:** to run several proxies side by side (each with its own providers, cooldowns, and log level), copy `compose.multi.example.yaml` to `compose.yaml` and give each service its own config file and host port:

```yaml
services:
  proxy-a:
    build: .
    command: ["--config", "/etc/gonka-proxy/config.yaml"]
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:58081:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./config-a.yaml:/etc/gonka-proxy/config.yaml:ro
  proxy-b:
    build: .
    command: ["--config", "/etc/gonka-proxy/config.yaml"]
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:58082:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./config-b.yaml:/etc/gonka-proxy/config.yaml:ro
```

Every service mounts its config at the same in-container path (`/etc/gonka-proxy/config.yaml`) — only the host-side file differs. `config-*.yaml` and `compose.yaml` are gitignored, so per-instance credentials never get committed.

**Native (no Docker):**

```sh
go run ./cmd/gonka-proxy --config config.yaml
```

## Point your app at it

Set your OpenAI-compatible client's `base_url` to `http://127.0.0.1:58081/v1` (or your chosen address) and use one of your `model_alias` values as the model name. The proxy handles the rest.
